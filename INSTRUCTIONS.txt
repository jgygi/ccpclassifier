INSTRUCTIONS TO RUN TENSORFLOW SCRIPTS:

1. Run "Terminal"
2. type: source ~/tensorflow/venv/bin/activate
3. type: cd Documents/PythonScripts/
4. type: python masterscript.py

NOTES:

Where to modify the code to change things:

1. Editing the 'classification' of Aux + and Aux -
- trackloader.py
- search for the comment 'Add classification parameters to this section'
- OR: search for this code block and make adjustments...
        #Check if Aux+ or Aux-
        # Add classification parameters to this section
        isAux = False
        pval_cutoff = pvalCutOff
        #Look for Consecutive True's
        if(lifetime < 20 and checkLifetime):
            numConsecPValTemp = numConsecPVal - 1
        else:
            numConsecPValTemp = numConsecPVal
        for x in range(len(pvals_t2) - (numConsecPValTemp - 1)):
            isSig = False
            for j in range(x, x + (numConsecPValTemp)):
                isSig = pvals_t2[j] <= pval_cutoff
                if not isSig:
                    break
            if mustBeSecondHalf:
                if (x < (int(lifetime)/2)):
                    isSig = False
            if isSig:
                isAux = True
        if isAux:
            # Classify as Aux +
            aux = 1
        else:
            # Classify as Aux -
            aux = 0

2. Change the machine learning parameters:
- for inputs such as 'learning rate', 'batch size', and 'steps', search for:
  NOTE: The learning rate, steps, and batch size are all inputted below. Modify them here to optimize model.
- for other inputs such as 'shuffling' and how many periods / repetitions, see the "Data Preparation" header.
